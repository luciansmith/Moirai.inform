This is my game that I hoped to enter into the 2024 IFComp, but I'm still working on it for an as-of-yet-undetermined Game Thing.  As such, this is not a public release, just a place for me to store my code.  Betatesters can get the latest version from here.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BETATESTERS:

This game is turning out to be written chronologically, which I didn't expect, but is working out OK.  Feedback right now should focus on the opening scene/room, and that's it.  There's an actual map, and you can test the exits if you like, but even there, there are known inadequacies, and most places are placeholders for future Stuff.

Also, I haven't really settled on a name, either for the game or for the park.  Suggestions (even 'I like this' / 'this could be better somehow') welcome.
