Gradually, you stitch together a new coherent view of your surroundings.&#x000A;&#x000A;Giant Pit (in the spiders)&#x000A;The entire hill has collapsed in on itself, revealing a giant pit underneath. Bushes and trees are frozen mid-fall, as they pitch forward into the yawning chasm.&#x000A;&#x000A;People are caught frozen in time but doomed:  a stumbling woman falling forward into the hole; a man clinging desperately to a cylinder of Coyote's Call as he and the cylinder plunge into the abyss.&#x000A;&#x000A;Coyote's Call is collapsing into the sinkhole along with everything else.  Frozen in time, the new configuration of its tubes and beams makes it seem even more joyfully chaotic.  You are probably the only person who will ever experience it this way, and it makes the combination of destruction and art intensely personal.&#x000A;&#x000A;This certainly seems to qualify as a disaster.  You take in your surroundings, determined to remember this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
