Straining, you manage to reassert your hold on time, freezing everything in place again.  Gradually, you stitch together a new coherent view of your surroundings.&#x000A;&#x000A;Giant Pit (in the spiders)&#x000A;The entire hill has collapsed in on itself, revealing a giant pit underneath. Bushes and trees are frozen mid-fall, as they pitch forward into the yawning chasm.&#x000A;&#x000A;People are caught frozen in time but doomed:  a stumbling woman falling forward into the hole; a man clinging desperately to a cylinder of Coyote's Call as he and the cylinder plunge into the abyss.&#x000A;&#x000A;Coyote's Call is collapsing into the sinkhole along with everything else.  Frozen in time, the new configuration of its tubes and beams makes it seem even more joyfully chaotic.  You are probably the only person who will ever experience it this way, and it makes the combination of destruction and art intensely personal.&#x000A;&#x000A;This certainly seems to qualify as a disaster.  You take in your surroundings, determined to remember this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">You anchor your consciousness in spiders on the walls of the cavern, and release your hold on time once more.  It's almost not enough:  the mass of dirt and detritus that pours down from above scrapes more than a few spiders from the walls, and it takes all your mental agility to maintain coherence as you flit between the slightly more anchored spider minds, before pulling time to a stop once again.&#x000A;&#x000A;Sinkhole (in the spiders)&#x000A;You're partway down a giant sinkhole that apparently has been growing under the park for some time.  Everything is caught in a state of falling:  dirt, grass, the red metal pieces of Coyote's Call, and the spiders themselves.&#x000A;&#x000A;People are frozen in time, falling past you.&#x000A;&#x000A;A spear of red metal from Coyote's Call falls through open space here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>
