Bushes and trees are frozen mid-fall, as they pitch forward into the yawning chasm.&#x000A;&#x000A;People are caught frozen in time but doomed:  a stumbling woman falling forward into the hole; a man clinging desperately to a cylinder of Coyote's Call as he and the cylinder plunge into the abyss.&#x000A;&#x000A;Coyote's Call is collapsing into the sinkhole along with everything else.  Frozen in time, the new configuration of its tubes and beams makes it seem even more joyfully chaotic.  You are probably the only person who will ever experience it this way, and it makes the combination of destruction and art intensely personal.&#x000A;&#x000A;This certainly seems to qualify as a disaster.

I've always wondered what it was like to be a Vested; I read President Calder's memoir like eight times and watched the "Forged in Flames" documentary about him twice, but they both seemed a little glossed-over, like they were both just painting him as kind of a generic hero.  And the ancient myths are more the stories people told about Vestedness, instead of the actual Vested, if that makes any sense.  Is this...

I've always wondered what it was like to be a Vested; I read President Calder's memoir like eight times and watched the "Forged in Flames" documentary about him twice, but they both seemed a little glossed-over, like they were both just painting him as kind of a generic hero.  And the ancient myths are more the stories people told about Vestedness, instead of the actual Vested, if that makes any sense.  Is this... He looks around, but the memory is gone.  ...your origin story?&#x000A;&#x000A;1) "Kind of, I guess.  It's, uh, not been easy."&#x000A;2) "Jace, I need your help."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
