"You got this, kid," he says "You've been doing great; this'll be just like the other times."  From Amaia's panicked expression, you can tell she disagrees, but she says nothing.

I've always wondered what it was like to be a Vested; I read President Calder's memoir like eight times and watched the "Forged in Flames" documentary about him twice, but they both seemed a little glossed-over, like they were both just painting him as kind of a generic hero.  And the ancient myths are more the stories people told about Vestedness, instead of the actual Vested, if that makes any sense.  Is this... He looks around, but the memory is gone.  ...your origin story?&#x000A;&#x000A;1) "Kind of, I guess.  It's, uh, not been easy."&#x000A;2) "Jace, I need your help."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>
