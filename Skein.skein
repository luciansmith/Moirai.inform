    <result xml:space="preserve">Amaia screeches into the parking lot, and expertly zips into an open spot.  She closes her eyes briefly, checking, then opens them again, only fractionally less concerned.  "OK," she says, breathlessly, "whatever it is that's going to happen hasn't happened yet.  Zora," she turns to you apologetically over her shoulder, "you won't have a lot of time, but the future's still branching, so it should be enough.  Lestar, you're up." &#x000A;&#x000A;From the passenger seat, Lestar grins at both of you, his white eyebrows quirking soothingly, and he reaches behind his seat to pat you reassuringly on the arm.  "You got this, kid," he says "You've been doing great; this'll be just like the other times."  From Amaia's panicked expression, you can tell she disagrees, but she says nothing.  You take a deep breath and grab Lestar's hand, dry and warm, and it grounds you.&#x000A;&#x000A;Amaia takes Lestar's other hand, then grabs yours, the contact sleek with sweat from both of you.  Lestar nods at you both, and closes his eyes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Everything freezes.&#x000A;&#x000A;You have all the time in the world.&#x000A;&#x000A;Fate's Gallery&#x000A;An Interactive Story by Lucian Smith&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 230808 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D&#x000A;&#x000A;Quinlan Park Parking Lot (in the Hyundai)&#x000A;Scattered cars fill the parking lot, including the Hyundai.

Even frozen, she radiates intensity and movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lestar's eyes are shut in calm concentration.  His relaxed hands hold yours and Amaia's, completing the triangle.&#x000A;&#x000A;In the area, you can sense the collective presence of dozens of spiders.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Lestar, you're up." &#x000A;&#x000A;From the passenger seat, Lestar grins at both of you, his white eyebrows quirking soothingly, and he reaches behind his seat to pat you reassuringly on the arm.  "You got this, kid," he says "You've been doing great; this'll be just like the other times."  From Amaia's panicked expression, you can tell she disagrees, but she says nothing.

"You got this, kid," he says "You've been doing great; this'll be just like the other times."  From Amaia's panicked expression, you can tell she disagrees, but she says nothing.
